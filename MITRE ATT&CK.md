# Basics of MITRE ATT&CK

## Introduction

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a framework widely used in the cybersecurity community to describe the actions and behaviors of adversaries in the cyber landscape. It provides a structured and comprehensive approach to understanding, categorizing, and mitigating cyber threats.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Tactics

Tactics represent the high-level objectives that adversaries aim to achieve during a cyber attack. These objectives often align with their ultimate goals, such as gaining unauthorized access to systems or exfiltrating sensitive data.

### 2. Techniques

Techniques are the specific methods or procedures that adversaries employ to accomplish their tactical objectives. Each technique describes a particular action or behavior that an attacker may use to exploit vulnerabilities or bypass security controls.

### 3. Procedures

Procedures provide further granularity to techniques by detailing specific variations or implementations of a particular approach. They allow for a more detailed understanding of how adversaries operate and can help defenders tailor their defenses accordingly.

### 4. Mitigations

Mitigations are proactive measures or countermeasures that organizations can implement to defend against potential attacks. They aim to reduce the likelihood or impact of successful adversarial actions by addressing vulnerabilities or strengthening security controls.

### 5. Possible Approaches

There are two approaches poosible :
- Think like an Attacker
- Think like an Defender

### 6. David J. Bianco's Pyramid of Pain

The Pyramid of Pain, introduced by David J. Bianco, illustrates the hierarchy of indicators of compromise (IoCs) based on their level of difficulty for adversaries to change. It ranges from low-level indicators such as file hashes to high-level indicators such as adversary tactics and techniques. By focusing on high-level indicators, defenders can make it more difficult for adversaries to succeed.

### 7. Threat Hunting

Threat hunting involves proactively searching for indicators of compromise or suspicious activities within an organization's network or systems. By leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework, threat hunters can identify patterns of behavior associated with known tactics and techniques used by adversaries, enabling early detection and response to potential threats.

## Using the ATT&CK Framework

### 1. Threat Intelligence

ATT&CK provides a common language for sharing and analyzing threat intelligence. Security analysts and researchers can use the framework to categorize observed behaviors, identify trends, and understand the tactics and techniques employed by different threat actors.

### 2. Red Team Exercises

Red team exercises involve simulating real-world attacks to assess an organization's security posture. By mapping their tactics and techniques to the ATT&CK framework, red teams can emulate the behavior of actual adversaries and help organizations identify and address security gaps.

### 3. Blue Team Analysis

Blue teams, responsible for defending against cyber threats, can use the ATT&CK framework to improve their detection and response capabilities. By understanding the tactics and techniques commonly used by adversaries, blue teams can develop more effective strategies for threat detection, incident response, and remediation.

## Conclusion

MITRE ATT&CK provides a valuable resource for understanding, categorizing, and mitigating cyber threats. By leveraging its structured approach and comprehensive knowledge base, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture and better protect against evolving threats in the digital landscape.
